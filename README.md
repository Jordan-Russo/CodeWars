This repository is a log containing Daily Coding Challenges that I've done to hone and refine critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Ranked <strong>top 1%</strong> on the global leaderboard with <strong>700</strong> and counting complete challenges and <strong>7+</strong> new solutions pushed every week.

## How It's Made:

A willingness and unwavering commitment to improving myself daily through the cheer of trial and challenge.

## Optimizations/Refactoring

My solutions often contain multiple versions of solutions as I think through the trade-offs of different algorithms to solve the same problem. Optimizations are made to establish a balance of readability under time/space complexity constraints. 

## Learned Lessons:

<p>One of the biggest lessons I have learned through tackling an extensive range of questions is the importance of comprehending the question or prompt before attempting to solve it.</p> 

<p>One effective method for doing this is to analyze the examples and walk the perimeter for all edge cases.</p>

<p>Once you have grasped the question, you may not have an optimal solution, but with good pseudo-code, you can begin the thought process to think deeply and consider the time and space complexity involved in your solution.</p>

<p>I've had numerous experiences while doing these challenges where after drafting the pseudo-code of the exercise I immediately thought of a better way to solve the problem (i.e. choosing a better data structure) and revised my solution after completing the current one.</p>

<p>By reflecting on your code and seeing how others tackled the same challenge, you can gain valuable exposure to the syntax and most effective structuring patterns of a language.</p>
